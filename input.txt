0:00
so your engagement with technology
0:02
doesn't just have to do with laziness or
0:04
discipline or you sucking at life it has
0:06
to do with a lot of like the state of
0:08
your mind your internal emotional state
0:10
your fatigue State all those kinds of
0:11
things
0:13
so I wasted five to six hours watching
0:15
YouTube and now I don't want to do
0:16
anything anymore
0:19
so I've I have some homework that I
0:21
needed to do over the weekend but
0:22
instead of utilizing my time to do stuff
0:24
I just blew five hours watching YouTube
0:25
and now I hate myself and I don't feel
0:27
like I deserve anything or anyone
0:30
I've tried to be productive several
0:32
times and now that has failed I don't
0:33
want to do anything anymore I want to be
0:35
perfect like everybody else when it
0:36
comes to their lives but I find that
0:38
hard and I want to cry when I can't do
0:40
anything that other people can do
0:42
I hate my life because I'm worth nothing
0:45
and I feel like I'm incapable of
0:46
everything that is presented to me I
0:48
want to get rid of this thing of not
0:50
being productive and all that this
0:52
happens frequently as well and I'm
0:53
hopeless about it I hate life
1:01
so
1:02
sometimes
1:04
instead of doing what we need to do
1:07
we end up watching lots of YouTube or
1:11
something else right play video games
1:13
spend time on Reddit like whatever
1:14
whatever pick your poison
1:17
the truth of the matter is though
1:18
sometimes it's like we have stuff that
1:20
we want to accomplish
1:22
and YouTube kind of gets in the way
1:26
and then what happens is when we like
1:30
slip up right by like five hours of
1:32
YouTube
1:34
we hate ourselves
1:37
and then we don't feel like we deserve
1:39
anything
1:40
we want to be perfect but we're the very
1:42
opposite of perfect our mind becomes
1:44
very very black and white it's like I
1:46
can't believe I wasted a whole day
1:51
I want to get rid of this thing I'm
1:52
tired of not being productive anymore I
1:54
want to be productive again help me be
1:56
productive again
2:00
so what do we do in this situation
2:03
so I was kind of reading this my first
2:05
thought is
2:07
well I wonder what's going on in
2:08
someone's brain
2:10
so I didn't really know I was like okay
2:12
what is watching five hours of YouTube
2:14
do to your brain so I know like
2:17
long-term effects of chronic technology
2:20
usage social media usage video games
2:22
things like that but at the five hour
2:25
mark what's going on in someone's brain
2:26
so the first thing that I did is I asked
2:28
that question and the answer is that I I
2:31
saw were actually terrifying so the
2:33
first thing that we're going to do is
2:34
just like do a quick dip into
2:35
neuroscience
2:38
okay
2:40
so there's some PA we're going to talk
2:43
about oh yeah so let's start with this
2:45
so there is this field called
2:50
consumer Neuroscience which terrifies me
2:53
as a psychiatrist
2:55
because what this means is that there's
2:57
like a group of people out there who are
2:59
studying the brain using things like
3:02
psychometrics functional neuroimaging
3:05
and behavioral data to figure out
3:08
how to get you to like buy stuff and
3:11
continue using
3:12
the internet
3:14
okay so the impact of motivation to
3:17
watch YouTube subjective Nora's
3:18
behavioral control information success
3:20
model to watching YouTube engagement
3:25
now this is important
3:27
measuring dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
3:31
signals predict the success of
3:33
merchandising elements at the point of
3:37
sale
3:44
brain activity forecasts video
3:46
engagement in an internet attention
3:48
market so here's something that
3:50
terrifies me
3:52
your free will
3:54
is now known as the internet attention
3:57
market and there's a lot of research out
3:59
there
4:01
about
4:03
how to get people
4:06
to like
4:07
how to like take this internet attention
4:09
market and like engage people with it
4:12
and sell things
4:14
okay
4:16
now this is what's really interesting so
4:17
the key thing that I kind of took away
4:19
from this that I thought was a little
4:20
bit different
4:21
is a lot of research on the anterior
4:23
insula so let's try to understand the
4:25
Neuroscience real quick
4:27
so here's what I I thought of when I
4:29
looked at this I was like okay I can
4:31
understand that people get distracted
4:33
and they don't want to you know
4:35
start doing homework it's boring so you
4:37
open up YouTube because you feel a
4:39
little bit distracted but then what I
4:41
got kind of curious about is why do we
4:42
waste five hours on YouTube because it's
4:45
not even fun after the first hour what's
4:47
going on there
4:50
and that's when I sort of discovered
4:51
that there's all all kinds of
4:52
interesting stuff and one of the key
4:54
pieces of Neuroscience here is the
4:56
anterior insula and the anterior insula
4:59
is actually
5:02
heavily involved with like
5:04
Insight
5:06
um it's also involved with the orgasm
5:08
which is kind of interesting
5:09
but
5:11
it in involves like it involves a lot of
5:14
like awareness and like a lot of our
5:17
Consciousness comes from the anterior
5:19
insula so when we're kind of thinking
5:21
about
5:22
okay like what do I want to do when
5:24
we're like regulating ourselves when we
5:26
think a particular way about ourselves
5:27
like a lot of this like emotional
5:29
awareness of what we're doing and like
5:31
being conscious is the anterior insula
5:34
and what we know from all this
5:35
commercial Neuroscience is that
5:38
buying things online and spending more
5:41
time on the Internet is inversely
5:44
correlated with anterior insular
5:46
activity
5:48
so what that sort of means is that the
5:50
more aware I am the less likely I am to
5:54
engage in with YouTube for five hours at
5:56
a stretch
5:58
and actually what tends to happen is as
6:00
we use technology what this internet
6:02
attention Market is doing
6:04
is finding ways to make us less aware
6:08
and what do I mean by finding ways to
6:10
make us less aware so when I watch a
6:12
particular video
6:14
so right now like I'm aware of my
6:16
surroundings what I need to do today my
6:18
mind is tracking all kinds of stuff
6:21
when I watch a video the engagement
6:23
level of that video is in how much it
6:26
allows me to forget
6:29
right so my you know poison of the month
6:31
this this month is watching these like
6:34
like
6:35
survival catching foraging eating
6:39
cooking things with fires
6:42
right it's like some dude who's like out
6:44
in the wilderness who's like making
6:45
fires and catching things and and
6:47
hunting for food and stuff like that and
6:49
it's like that's like when I watch that
6:51
video for 30 minutes like I completely
6:52
forget about everything else that's
6:54
going on in my life
6:55
in my anterior insula shuts down and
6:58
there's data that shows that the less
6:59
active your interior insula is the more
7:02
likely you are to engage in this
7:05
internet attention Marketplace the more
7:07
likely you are to watch YouTube for hour
7:08
four five six seven eight nine ten
7:12
so this is like the first thing that
7:14
you've got to understand is that if
7:16
you're in this situation and you're
7:17
blaming yourself
7:19
for being so lazy instead of being so
7:22
motivated like I don't think you really
7:24
realize how outgunned you really are
7:29
did you get a little distracted sure
7:31
but there's a whole emerging field of
7:34
consumer Neuroscience which people are
7:37
publishing papers about and having
7:39
conferences on and things like that
7:41
where people are like literally learning
7:43
like like this is terrifying I'm going
7:45
to just show you all this again
7:47
like look at this
7:50
one
7:53
I don't know if y'all so
7:55
you know
7:57
we're using
7:58
Neuro Imaging to figure out
8:02
how to
8:03
engage people with point of point of
8:06
sale devices
8:11
right it's kind of weird
8:13
like there's so much stuff going on here
8:15
that's super terrifying
8:18
so now let's try to understand a little
8:19
bit about okay if I wanna like let's go
8:21
back to the issue at hand which is I
8:24
need to do homework and I can't because
8:25
I got distracted on YouTube for five
8:27
hours so we're gonna break this apart
8:29
into a couple of things the first thing
8:31
is why do we start watching something or
8:35
start engaging with technology the
8:37
second thing is why do we persist in
8:39
engaging with technology the third thing
8:41
is what does long-term engagement with
8:43
technology do to our brain and our
8:45
motivation and our self-esteem and how
8:47
do we pull everything how do we kind of
8:49
tie everything together at the end okay
8:51
so first thing why do we start using
8:52
technology
8:53
very very very well understood I feel
8:56
incredibly confident in what I'm about
8:57
to say
8:59
when I'm trying to do homework I don't
9:02
want to do the homework but chances
9:04
whether I do the homework or don't do
9:06
the homework actually depends on my
9:07
internal emotional state
9:09
the more confident in myself I feel the
9:12
less fatigued I am
9:14
the less uh the the more
9:18
I care about myself and the more
9:21
positive emotions I feel the more likely
9:24
I am to do the homework
9:26
how do we know this well we know that
9:28
when we reach for technology what it
9:30
tends to do is suppress our negative
9:33
emotional circuitry
9:35
and so generally speaking the worse we
9:37
feel about ourselves the more likely we
9:39
are to use technology the more fatigued
9:42
we are the more likely we are to use
9:44
technology this is part of the reason
9:46
why
9:47
especially like a lot of these financial
9:49
decisions are getting worse so if you
9:51
look at people who are like buying
9:52
crypto or Wall Street bets or even like
9:54
online gambling sites the reason these
9:57
all three of these things are so
10:00
successful from a provider standpoint
10:01
we're not talking about the purchaser
10:03
we're talking about like the exchange or
10:07
you know like like day trade uh sorry
10:09
retail trading like Robin Hood or like
10:10
all these things are so successful
10:13
because they allow you to make decisions
10:15
when you're fatigued
10:17
so it used to be that markets were open
10:19
only at a particular time
10:22
so if you wanted to make a trade you had
10:24
to open it like you had to like go
10:26
through some some hoops as well as there
10:28
was a particular time that you had to
10:30
make trades so you couldn't be like
10:32
drunk at 3am in the morning and spend a
10:35
hundred thousand dollars by buying some
10:37
means meme stock
10:39
but what we've discovered is that as our
10:41
brains become more dysregulated and as
10:43
we can make purchases in the wee hours
10:46
of the morning when we're drunk when
10:48
we're High when we're tired whatever
10:50
it leads us to make bad purchases and
10:52
people are profiting off of this
10:55
so your engagement with technology
10:57
doesn't just have to do with laziness or
10:59
discipline or you sucking at life it has
11:01
to do with a lot of like the state of
11:03
your mind your internal emotional state
11:05
your fatigue State all those kinds of
11:07
things
11:08
that's why we start using and what our
11:10
brain has figured out is I feel bad
11:12
about myself let me engage in this
11:14
technology which will self-soothe and
11:17
shut down my negative emotional
11:18
circuitry
11:20
then what happens that's how we start
11:22
using technology then what happens like
11:25
why do we end up using technology for
11:26
five hours so as technology becomes more
11:29
engaging we start to see suppression of
11:32
the anterior insular cortex which is our
11:35
awareness
11:36
so then we don't realize that one hour
11:38
became two became three became four
11:40
became five
11:41
and I love this personally in the
11:44
turn-based strategy games right so if
11:46
you guys play turn-based strategy game
11:47
you'll understand this very well one
11:49
more term one more turn one more turn
11:51
I'm going to load up a game of civ4 fall
11:54
from Heaven at 5 pm on a Friday and I'm
11:57
going to come back to awareness Saturday
12:00
morning at dawn
12:03
right that's what technology does we
12:05
lose that insular cortex stuff
12:08
then what happens is we blame ourselves
12:10
because now it's like oh my god I've
12:12
stayed up all night I'm so undisciplined
12:15
and then what happens is we start to
12:17
hate ourselves
12:20
okay
12:21
like look at this language incapable of
12:24
everything
12:26
I want to be perfect I've tried to be
12:29
productive
12:31
and so all of that negative emotion
12:33
comes roaring back
12:36
and when all that negative emotion comes
12:38
roaring back
12:42
that in turn leads to things like
12:44
procrastination because it's hard to
12:46
focus on homework when internally you're
12:49
filled with self-loathing
12:51
right like that kind of makes sense
12:53
right the more self-loathing I feel the
12:55
harder it is to do homework
12:58
and then we call this thing
12:59
procrastination but what we know is that
13:02
a lot of procrastination has to do with
13:04
incorrect emotional processing and
13:07
incorrect emotional awareness
13:09
we just call it procrastination because
13:10
we're not even aware of what we feel on
13:13
the inside
13:14
and at the end of the cycle we feel so
13:16
bad about ourselves that we're teeing
13:18
ourselves up for failure next time
13:20
around
13:22
so once I feel really terrible about
13:23
myself do I sit there and process up my
13:26
emotions talk to my friends go see a
13:28
therapist work with a coach do I like
13:30
like actually like take this kind of
13:31
situation and and like really work
13:33
through it and undo all the emotional
13:36
damage of course not
13:37
I make a post on the internet
13:40
people give me like Solutions they're
13:42
like hey use this task management system
13:43
which can be useful don't get me wrong
13:45
but none of that emotional stuff gets
13:48
addressed
13:49
and if none of that emotional stuff gets
13:51
addressed you can use whatever task
13:52
management systems you want to if you
13:53
wake up in the morning and you feel like
13:55
you're a waste of a human being it's
13:56
going to get really hard to be motivated
14:01
right because what kind of stuff
14:02
motivates people
14:04
inspiration motivates people excitement
14:06
motivates people confidence motivates
14:08
people
14:09
but at the end of this whole cycle we're
14:11
beating ourselves up we have a bunch of
14:13
negative emotion and the whole cycle
14:14
repeats
14:18
so what do you do in this kind of
14:19
situation so a couple of simple things
14:21
the first is recognize your black and
14:23
white thinking
14:25
so if you're thinking in All or Nothing
14:27
statements if you're saying
14:29
you know I'm I'm a complete waste of
14:32
space other people are perfect I can't
14:34
succeed in anything I do
14:36
black and white thinking is a sign of
14:39
emotional activity in the amygdala in
14:41
the hippocampus it means that you're
14:44
emotionally charged and you're not
14:46
thinking logically it means you're
14:47
thinking emotionally
14:49
right so if you think about people who
14:51
use a lot of black and white language
14:52
they're very emotional thinkers they
14:54
think they're logical but they're really
14:56
not logical right because like the truth
14:58
of the matter is the world is a nuanced
15:00
place and very few things are black and
15:02
white
15:03
like it's just not how reality is
15:06
there is an a religion that is better
15:08
than all the other religions or a
15:09
religion that is worse than all the
15:11
other religions
15:12
maybe that's a charge statement that's
15:14
going to get invoke a lot of black and
15:16
white thinking and engage emotions if
15:18
you responded to that and now you feel
15:19
emotions you'll kind of see what I'm
15:20
saying
15:21
right but people who talk that way tend
15:23
to be very black and white thinkers and
15:25
if you challenge them on that they will
15:27
get very emotional
15:29
they'll use logic sure but like behind
15:32
the logic is a bunch of emotion
15:35
and so you've got to decompress that
15:37
emotion
15:39
so notice the black and white thinking
15:41
and then start to ask yourself okay how
15:42
did I start to feel so bad about myself
15:46
start to notice a little bit about when
15:48
I'm sitting down to do homework how do I
15:50
feel about that
15:51
and this is the key thing if you're if
15:53
you're one of these people I can
15:54
guarantee you what you're going to say
15:56
in that moment is who cares how I feel
16:00
I need to do it
16:03
who cares what I feel and it's by making
16:06
that statement you lose emotional
16:08
awareness because now you're not
16:09
exploring it you're actively devaluing
16:11
it and when you actively devalue it and
16:14
when you actively suppress it and ignore
16:16
it then it starts to manifest in other
16:18
ways like procrastination lack of
16:20
motivation spending five hours watching
16:21
YouTube
16:23
because negative emotions have to be
16:25
dealt with
16:27
they will deal with you and keep dealing
16:29
with you until you deal with them
16:34
so you've got to become more emotionally
16:35
aware become aware of your black and
16:37
white thinking start to ask yourself
16:38
questions like how do I feel about doing
16:41
homework today do I want to do it do I
16:43
not want to do it
16:45
why don't I want to do it well I need to
16:47
do it who cares what I want well like I
16:50
care what you want right what you want
16:52
should be important to you and oddly
16:54
enough by acknowledging what you want or
16:57
what you care about
16:59
and giving that value you actually make
17:02
it easier to do the task
17:07
I'll give you all a simple example
17:11
so let's say that
17:19
I'll just give you all kind of an
17:20
example so I I was out a couple weekends
17:23
ago with my kids
17:24
and one of them wanted to eat something
17:27
that wasn't available
17:28
okay so they're like Dad I want this
17:30
food
17:32
and then I've got two options I can say
17:35
I don't care what you want you're gonna
17:37
eat what we give you
17:40
right you have to eat what we have what
17:42
we've got like we've only got one thing
17:44
we can't get it so like I don't really
17:45
it doesn't matter what you want you've
17:46
got to eat what we give you or I can say
17:49
hey I understand what you want I'm sorry
17:52
I can't give it to you
17:54
I'll do my best to get it for you next
17:56
time
17:57
but I didn't know that you wanted that
17:58
earlier and I'd really appreciate it if
18:01
you ate this anyway
18:02
and I'm going to do my level best to get
18:04
it for you next time
18:06
how does that sound
18:08
which one do you think leads to like
18:10
better success
18:12
in both cases the kid may end up eating
18:14
it but in one case they're going to eat
18:16
way better than the other
18:22
right
18:22
does that kind of make sense so we have
18:24
to acknowledge like and this is where
18:26
like sometimes
18:27
you know we make sacrifices because we
18:30
have to make sacrifices but it's really
18:31
nice to acknowledge the sacrifice
18:34
and be honest about it right
18:36
it's really nice to say hey like I'm
18:38
sorry that you have to do this
18:41
it really sucks
18:43
I really appreciate that you're doing it
18:47
I'm grateful
18:49
like that's going to lead to better
18:50
stuff down the road but that's not how
18:51
we talk to ourselves
18:55
need to do it
18:58
when you need to do something over the
18:59
weekend you're going to end up
19:00
procrastinating until the last minute
19:03
it's how it works
19:06
so unfortunately it's really common to
19:08
like get ourselves distracted
19:10
with technology usage it turns out
19:12
there's a lot going on in the brain
19:14
it starts with why we start to use a
19:16
technology which tends to be the most
19:19
common reason is like emotional
19:20
suppression
19:22
and not having to face our emotions then
19:24
we get sucked into it and we blame
19:26
ourselves for watching it for five hours
19:29
when we don't even acknowledge that
19:30
there's a whole
19:32
ton of like people who are doing
19:34
consumer Neuroscience to keep you there
19:36
for five hours
19:37
there are people with phds and MDS and
19:40
economists and all kinds of stuff
19:41
working to keep you on that website for
19:43
five hours because there's an attention
19:45
Marketplace and what is being bought or
19:48
sold in the attention Marketplace you
19:51
are
19:54
and then we blame ourselves
19:56
and with a complete lack of compassion
19:58
and a lot of black and white thinking
20:00
and self-blame we set ourselves up for
20:03
failure tomorrow because then tomorrow
20:04
if I'm a POS who wastes all my time
20:07
watching YouTube and I'm filled with
20:09
self-loathing how am I ever going to be
20:11
inspired to actually like do my homework
20:15
never gonna happen it's going to be a a
20:18
slog
20:19
every single time every single time you
20:21
bring yourself to do your homework it's
20:23
like you're dragging cattle
20:27
it's so hard
20:30
and then since it takes so much effort
20:32
for you to even do homework for a little
20:34
while you're mentally fatigued mentally
20:36
exhausted and then what do you think you
20:38
reach for
20:39
technology because now you're fatigued
20:44
and so it's super super challenging
20:46
unfortunately increasingly common and
20:49
why is it increasingly common is it
20:51
because people are becoming lazier and
20:53
more disciplined on the whole no
20:56
it is because there is an attention
20:57
Marketplace which people are getting
21:00
very Savvy to in learning how to
21:01
manipulate and they realize that if you
21:04
spend six hours on YouTube instead of
21:06
twitch
21:07
or twitch instead of tick tock
21:11
one of those platforms gets money and
21:13
the other two don't
21:15
and all the platforms want money
21:18
and they're happy
21:19
to
21:20
give you the content that you want to I
21:22
don't think necessarily the platform's
21:24
are nefarious by the way
21:26
I think a lot of times the platforms are
21:28
out there trying to like do good
21:29
they're like hey we're just entertainers
21:31
right we're not worried about that kind
21:33
of stuff but as this stuff is evolving
21:35
it's starting to get out of control and
21:37
sometimes we end up being the victims
21:39
and that's where you can rage at the
21:41
platforms all you want to I don't know
21:43
how effective that's going to be this is
21:44
where ultimately I think you've got to
21:46
understand what's going on in my mind
21:48
and what can I do about it
21:51
so hopefully that helps if you're
21:53
struggling with productivity and end up
21:55
you know using a technology platform for
21:57
like six hours and procrastinating
